# Crowdfunding_ETL
Project 2

Project Members: Hamid Nazari, Ryan Lund

Instructions:
1) 'ETL_Project_2' file is the final code for the assignment.
2) 'Crowdfunding_bd_schema' file should be opened in pgAdmin and run to create the tables.
4) 'db_diagram' file was used to create the 'Crowdfunding_bd_schema' file.
5) 'pgadmin_db' file is a screen of the crowdfunding_db created in pgAdmin. This is the evidence of the database creation.
6) The csv source files ('category', 'subcategory', 'contacts' and 'campaign') are all located in the Resources folder. Import these files in the order that tables were created in pgAdmin.
7) 'select_queries' should be opened in pgAdmin once the 'Crowdfunding_bd_schema' file has been run and the CSV files have been successfully imported into pgAdmin. Run each of the 4 lines of code to verify that all 4 tables were created successfully.
